# Retrofit
<b>A simple retrofit examle with kotlin</b><br>
In this project, I read one json file that contains some information and finally, display the information in my app.
<br>Note : There is another retrofit example in my github account which can help you learn retrofit better (if you're an amature) you can access it <a href="https://github.com/mahdi-1384/Retrofit-DataBinding">here</a>
